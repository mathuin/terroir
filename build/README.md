# Build notes

The purpose of this package is to take the map data generated by the
carto package and construct a Minecraft world using the tools in the
world package.

## Move newbiome code here and use it for the basis of building worlds!

The newbiome code in the carto package needs to move over here and be
the basic worker for the concurrent world building.  The work
generator will polygonize the lcarr and send polygons to the input
channel.  The worker will translate polygons into biome values and
columns and send that to the output channel.  The output receiver will
take that data and use it to populate a world.

## Translation between landcover definitions

Not all landcover maps use the same values for the same landcover
types.  This needs to be addressed eventually in the carto package
(for bathy) as well as this package.  Not sure the best way to do
this, partly because I don't have any decent examples.  My current
approach is to convert everyone to NLCD 2011, but what I might do is
make an enum and use that.  Then I can supply an XML dict for NLCD
2011 to the enum, and the workers can just add enums as necessary.
Maybe.

# Stuff to keep in mind

## Optimizations

Maybe do SetBlock() on a section level?
